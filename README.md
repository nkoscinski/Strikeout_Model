This is a Python-based project that does the following:
- scrapes baseball data from the web (Brooksbaseball)
- process that data for the pitcher and batter based on various pitch countss
- use that data to create a transition matrix and markov chains that attempt to predict the probability of a given pitcher striking out a given batter

Additional Notes:
- I am just coming back to this project after not working on it for a few weeks
- Currently does not run without error because I am integrating the web scraping aspect of the project
- Previously the web scraping aspect of the project was a seperate script that saved the dataframes as CSV files
- Now working on using  improving this

If anyone happens to look at this and have any questions and/or suggestions I would be happy to talk!
