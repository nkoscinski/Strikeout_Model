This is a Python-based project that does the following:
- scrapes baseball data from the web (Brooksbaseball)
- processes that data for the pitcher and batter based on various pitch counts
- use that data to create a transition matrix that attempt to predict the probability of a given pitcher striking out a given batter

Additional Notes:
- I am just coming back to this project after a few weeks of not working on it
- Currently, the project only works for a single pitcher and batter
- The final product will work seamlessly for any pitcher and lineup
- I am also working on making sure the math behind the transition matrix and final strikeout probability is correct

Final Note:
- This model in no way encompasses all the various factors that go into a pitcher striking out a batter
- It is simply a fun project that I am working on to learn more about data science within baseball
- As I have more time to work on this project, I will continue to add more features and make it more robust

If anyone happens to look at this and have any questions and/or suggestions I would love to talk!
